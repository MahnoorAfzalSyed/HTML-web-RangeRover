# RangeR-Website
This website was created in 2024 as part of my Web Development module for the Bachelor of Software Engineering degree at university. I built the project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Visual Studio Code. The website showcases a visually interactive "Range Rover" design, focusing on clean layout and user interaction through dynamic front-end techniques.
